# First look at AWS Chronos
Foundation models for time series have been getting a lot of hype recently. So I decided to try out [AWS Chronos](https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting). 

So far, the results are underwhelming. Looking [under the hood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07815), it would appear like the model is trained on only a few billion data points. While that might sound like a lot, that's about how much data the geophysics community had [twenty five years ago](https://ds.iris.edu/files/stats/data/archive/Archive_Growth.jpg).
